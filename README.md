re-learning git

- Hi, I'm @diegokieck and i work with data driven systems. It has become incressingly difficul to label profecionals working with data process. I have used many hats in both academia and business. NLP researcher,  Data Scientist, machine learning engineer, software engineer, Lecturer, business analyst to just name a few. I thinck that will be the charm and challenge in the next century: how to link an everchanging set of skills to deploy value in accordance to the organization, be it a research project or product development. 

-I'm interested in the life cycle of Inteligent models. How can capture knowledge from many sources and store them in way that is consumable.
